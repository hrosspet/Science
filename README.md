Science
=======
In this repository I am gonna store and share my scientific diary. For now it consists of just three files:
* Read: containing references to articles I read together with my notes
* Inspiration: references to articles I might wanna read in the future, possibly with some notes why I should read it
* Projects: description of my actual personal projects. I will not share here any information about my main job because of an non-disclosure agreement.
