=======

* Implement a heuristic finding algorithm for 15-puzzle problem using any method of abstractions or relaxations. The heuristic should enable solving problems of size greater than n=5 (which at the moment I am able to solve optimally) and at least n=9. (0 %)

* Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Goedel, Escher, Bach</a> (174/832 ~ 21%)

* Data science [tasks](http://www.kaggle.com) with $$ prizes
